def compile(arg=None, nderivs=1, optimize=True, enabled=True):
    """
    Decorator which marks a function or module class as eligible for
    just-in-time compilation.  The next time the function/module is executed, it
    is traced, and the trace is compiled into an optimized representation which
    is run in lieu of the original Python code upon subsequent invocations of
    the function/module.

    .. note::

        A JIT compiled function/module may be compiled multiple times, as
        different inputs can result in different traces.  Currently, the
        JIT compiler conservatively assumes the trace may change if the
        `size` or `requires_grad` of `Variable` inputs change, or if
        any of the non-Variable inputs change.  For example, if you JIT
        compile an RNN which takes the number of hidden units as a parameter,
        we will compile a trace for every RNN length you use at runtime.

        When a module class is JIT compiled, each instantiation of the module
        gets a separate trace cache.

    .. warning::

        Just-in-time compilation currently only works for functions/modules
        which are not data dependent (e.g., have conditionals on data in
        tensors) and do not have any untracked external dependencies (e.g.,
        perform input/output or access global variables). If you trace such
        models, you will silently get incorrect results on subsequent
        invocations of the model.

    Keyword arguments:
        nderivs (int, optional): the number of derivatives which this function/module
            will be used with.  You MUST accurately specify this number: set it too
            low and you will see an error when you attempt to run `backward`;
            set it too high, and the function/module will never be compiled
            (as we always wait to see all derivatives before compiling.)
            Default: 1 (i.e., we will compile forwards and backwards, but not
            double-backwards).
        optimize (bool, optional): whether or not to apply optimizations.  Default: ``True``.

    Debug arguments:
        time (bool, optional): if ``True``, whenever we execute the model in question, we
            will also print out some timing information for how long the model
            took to execute.  At the moment, there are three types of timings we
            emit:

                - unoptimized: the time it took to execute the vanilla Python
                  model.  This only occurs when tracing is disabled, e.g., via
                  `enabled=False`

                - tracing: the time it took to execute the vanilla Python model
                  with tracing enabled.

                - optimized: the time it took to execute the optimized model.

            At the moment, all of these timings are for the forward pass only.
            Default: ``False``.
        enabled (bool, optional): if ``False``, compilation is disabled and you
            will get back your original model.  This is a convenient way to
            disable tracing without having to delete the annotation. Default: ``True``.

    Example: Compile as class decorator.

        >>> @jit.compile
        >>> class MyModel(nn.Module):
        >>>     ...
        >>> model = MyModel()
        >>> out1 = model(x)        # interpreted run
        >>> out1.sum().backward()  # won't compile without this line
        >>> out2 = model(x)        # compiled run
        >>> out2.sum().backward()  # also compiled

    Example: Compile forward pass only as class decorator.

        >>> @jit.compile(nderivs=0)
        >>> class MyModel(nn.Module):
        >>>     ...
        >>> model = MyModel()
        >>> out1 = model(x)        # interpreted run
        >>> out2 = model(x)        # compiled run

    Example: Compile as function decorator.  The same modes of use for the class
    decorator are also supported for functions; however, the decorated
    function must declare *all* Variable inputs in its arguments.

        >>> @jit.compile
        >>> def f(x):
        >>>     return x * 2
